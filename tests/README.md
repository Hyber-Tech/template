# Tests Directory

## Overview
The `tests/` directory contains automated test scripts designed to verify the functionality and performance of the codebase. It includes unit tests, integration tests, and other types of test cases.

## Structure
- **unit/**: Unit tests for individual components.
- **integration/**: Tests that cover multiple components working together.
- **fixtures/**: Common test data and setups used across multiple test cases.

## Guidelines
- Write tests for all new code where feasible.
- Keep tests up-to-date as changes are made to the codebase.
- Ensure that tests are clear and cover as many cases as possible.

## Usage
Run tests regularly to ensure that code changes do not break existing functionality. Integrate with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing.
