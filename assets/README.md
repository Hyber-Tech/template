# Assets Directory

## Overview
This `assets/` directory is intended for storing all static resources used in the project. This includes images, fonts, external CSS, or any other media resources required by the project.

## Structure
- **images/**: Contains all image files used in the project.
- **fonts/**: Place all custom font files here.
- **css/**: For standalone CSS files.

## Guidelines
- Please ensure that all resources are properly optimized for performance.
- Follow naming conventions consistent with the rest of the project to maintain clarity and prevent conflicts.

## Usage
Reference these assets in your project code as needed. Ensure paths are relative to the location of the asset within this directory.
