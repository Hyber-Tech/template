# Source Code Directory

## Overview
The `src/` directory contains the main source code for the project. This is where all the primary development happens, and it should include all the logic necessary to run the project.

## Structure
- **main.py**: The main entry point for the program.
- **modules/**: Folder for project-specific modules or packages.
- **utils/**: Utility scripts and helper functions.

## Guidelines
- Maintain clean and well-commented code throughout.
- Follow the project's coding standards and style guide.

## Usage
This directory's structure should be modular, allowing for easy expansion and maintenance. Code should be self-explanatory where possible, with comments added for complex logic.
